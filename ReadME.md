About Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) 
that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models 
that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions 
based on data. It encompasses a wide range of techniques, including 
supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning, among others.
